> Cooler testing
> Change returned value DONE ******
> Multiple cuckoos in one nest
> Generic classes
> Generic methods
> Args wrapped in classes
> out and ref parameters -> how about an exposed parameter class? This is needed to output these...
> async
> Cuckoos declared in other assemblies
> Name-provision encapsulated DONE *****
> Light-weight SyncLock on args creation
> Use abstract CallBase class, with only sub-methods emitted
