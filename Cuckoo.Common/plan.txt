Each method to be meddled with 


*** NOMENCLATURE ***

Millinery is a veritable hive of cross-cutting metaphors:

Millinery - the art of hat-making.
Fillet - a band used to tidy the hair into a hat.

The dominant imagery local to this project is then that of affixing hats onto methods, each of which
must be tidied into its new form by a fillet.


Below us, however, is quite another regime, that of birds and nests:

Fody - a small, nest-making bird.
Weaving - how the little bird makes its nest.

Think then of the fody's woven nests raised upwards, turned upside-down, and stacked neatly on top of a balding head.

Of course, Millinery.Fody also concerns itself with additions to a method's *tail* - but we ignore this.
